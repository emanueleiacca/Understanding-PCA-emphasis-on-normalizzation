# PCA Analysis with Standardization and Different Techniques
This GitHub repository explores the effects of standardization and various techniques on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using two different datasets: Iris and Wine.

# Overview
PCA is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis. One of the key questions in PCA is whether to standardize the data before performing the analysis. This repository investigates how PCA results change when applied to standardized and non-standardized data, as well as the effects of different normalization techniques.

# Datasets
## Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset often used for introductory data analysis. Here, we perform PCA on the Iris dataset with and without standardization. Surprisingly, we find that the primary difference lies in the explained variability. The actual components remain similar, demonstrating the robustness of PCA to data scaling.

## Wine Dataset
The Wine dataset is more complex and larger. We delve into the challenges of not standardizing data before PCA. In this case, we observe a principal component that explains 99% of the variability, highlighting the potential pitfalls of not standardizing data in certain scenarios.

## Standardization
We compare the results of PCA when the data is standardized (mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) and when it is not. The analysis reveals insights into the impact of standardization on PCA outcomes.

# Normalization Techniques
We also experiment with different normalization techniques, including:

Standardization: Mean-centered and scaled to unit variance.
Normalization: Scaling data to the range [0, 1].
Normalization with Base 100: Scaling data with a specific base.
These experiments illustrate how different normalization techniques affect the PCA results, shedding light on the importance of selecting the right preprocessing method for your data.

# Conclusion
This repository serves as an exploration of PCA analysis with a focus on standardization and normalization techniques. The findings suggest that the choice of data preprocessing can significantly impact PCA results, and this impact may vary depending on the dataset and its characteristics.
